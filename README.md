# Amazon Clone 🛒

A front-end Amazon clone built using **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by the Apna College CSS tutorial.

This project replicates the layout and design of Amazon's homepage, including the navigation bar, hero section, product grid, and footer. It is fully static and intended for learning front-end web development.
